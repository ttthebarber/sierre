# Account Deletion Setup Guide

## üóëÔ∏è Overview
This guide explains how to set up the account deletion functionality in your Sierre application. The system includes a secure two-step confirmation process and comprehensive data cleanup.

## üîß Setup Steps

### 1. Create Supabase Function

Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create a function to delete user and all associated data
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION delete_user()
RETURNS void
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
DECLARE
    user_id UUID;
BEGIN
    -- Get the current user's ID
    user_id := auth.uid();
    
    -- Check if user is authenticated
    IF user_id IS NULL THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'User not authenticated';
    END IF;
    
    -- Delete from custom tables (in order to respect foreign key constraints)
    DELETE FROM subscriptions WHERE user_id = user_id;
    DELETE FROM orders WHERE user_id = user_id;
    DELETE FROM products WHERE user_id = user_id;
    DELETE FROM stores WHERE user_id = user_id;
    DELETE FROM user_profiles WHERE id = user_id;
    
    -- Delete from auth.users (this will cascade to related auth tables)
    DELETE FROM auth.users WHERE id = user_id;
    
END;
$$;

-- Grant execute permission to authenticated users
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION delete_user() TO authenticated;
```

### 2. Optional: Add Cleanup Trigger

For additional safety, add a trigger that automatically cleans up data:

```sql
-- Create a trigger to automatically clean up data when a user is deleted
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_user_deletion()
RETURNS TRIGGER
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Clean up any remaining data when a user is deleted from auth.users
    DELETE FROM subscriptions WHERE user_id = OLD.id;
    DELETE FROM orders WHERE user_id = OLD.id;
    DELETE FROM products WHERE user_id = OLD.id;
    DELETE FROM stores WHERE user_id = OLD.id;
    DELETE FROM user_profiles WHERE id = OLD.id;
    
    RETURN OLD;
END;
$$;

-- Create the trigger
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_auth_user_deleted ON auth.users;
CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_deleted
    BEFORE DELETE ON auth.users
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION handle_user_deletion();
```

## üéØ Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Two-Step Confirmation Process
1. **First Step:** User must type "DELETE" to confirm
2. **Second Step:** Final confirmation with account details
3. **Security:** Prevents accidental deletions

### ‚úÖ Comprehensive Data Cleanup
The deletion process removes:
- User's Shopify stores and connections
- All order history and analytics
- Product information and inventory data
- Subscription and billing information
- User profile and settings
- Authentication data

### ‚úÖ User-Friendly Interface
- Clear warnings about data loss
- Step-by-step confirmation process
- Loading states and error handling
- Accessible design with proper ARIA labels

### ‚úÖ Security Features
- Requires user authentication
- Two-step confirmation process
- Clear data impact warnings
- Secure server-side deletion function

## üìç Where to Find Account Deletion

Users can delete their account from:
1. **Settings Page** ‚Üí **Account Management** section
2. **Red "Danger Zone"** card at the bottom
3. **"Delete Account"** button with warning

## üß™ Testing Account Deletion

### Test the Complete Flow:
1. **Sign up** with a test email
2. **Connect a Shopify store** (optional)
3. **Go to Settings** page
4. **Click "Delete Account"** button
5. **Type "DELETE"** in confirmation field
6. **Click "Continue to Final Step"**
7. **Click "Delete My Account"**
8. **Verify** user is redirected to home page
9. **Verify** user cannot sign in with deleted account

### Test Error Scenarios:
- Try deleting without typing "DELETE"
- Test network error handling
- Verify proper error messages

## üîí Security Considerations

### Data Protection:
- All user data is permanently deleted
- No data recovery is possible after deletion
- Foreign key constraints are respected
- Cascade deletion handles related data

### User Protection:
- Two-step confirmation prevents accidents
- Clear warnings about data loss
- User can cancel at any step
- Loading states prevent double-clicks

### System Protection:
- Function requires authentication
- Server-side validation
- Proper error handling
- Audit trail in Supabase logs

## üìã Compliance Features

### GDPR Compliance:
- Complete data deletion
- No data retention after deletion
- User-initiated deletion
- Clear data impact warnings

### User Rights:
- Right to deletion
- Clear consent process
- Data portability (export before deletion)
- Transparent process

## üö® Important Notes

### Before Production:
1. **Test thoroughly** with real data
2. **Backup your database** before setup
3. **Verify all tables** are included in cleanup
4. **Test edge cases** (users with no data, etc.)
5. **Document the process** for your team

### Monitoring:
- Monitor deletion requests in Supabase logs
- Track any errors or failures
- Consider analytics on deletion patterns
- Set up alerts for unusual deletion activity

## üîÑ Alternative Approaches

### Soft Delete (Optional):
If you need to retain data for legal/compliance reasons:

```sql
-- Instead of hard delete, mark as deleted
UPDATE users SET deleted_at = NOW() WHERE id = user_id;
```

### Scheduled Cleanup:
For soft deletes, implement a cleanup job:

```sql
-- Delete soft-deleted records after 30 days
DELETE FROM users WHERE deleted_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Supabase function logs
2. Verify user permissions
3. Test with different user scenarios
4. Review foreign key constraints
5. Check for any custom triggers
